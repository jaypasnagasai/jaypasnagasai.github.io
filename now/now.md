# What I'm Doing Now

Last updated: April 2025

## 🧠 Research

I'm currently diving deep into **semantic search for preclinical research**, refining a system that can intelligently surface insights from over 100,000 research papers. It’s like trying to teach a machine to think like a domain expert.

## 👨‍💻 Projects

- Building a **search engine** that blends NLP and biomedical ontologies.
- Exploring **LLM compression** and **retrieval-augmented generation** pipelines.

## 📚 Learning

- Getting sharper at **Rust** and **LangChain**.
- Reading _“The Alignment Problem”_ by Brian Christian.

## 💙 Life

- Helping someone special navigate gut health issues – it’s been humbling and meaningful.
- Trying to be present, consistent, and kind.

## 🎧 Listening To

- Lo-fi playlists and the occasional Hans Zimmer soundscape.
