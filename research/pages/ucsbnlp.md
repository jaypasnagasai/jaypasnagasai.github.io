# UCSB NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING GROUP

In this ongoing research project, I am developing a dataset of 500 scenarios to train AI multi-agent systems with a focus on privacy-preserving interactions. The project involves designing and implementing strategies that enhance AI agentsâ€™ ability to maintain user privacy while enabling natural and coherent communication.

By exploring various methods, I aim to improve the clarity and effectiveness of AI agent interactions, ensuring that privacy is safeguarded without compromising communication quality. This project is still in progress, and I will provide updates and insights once it is completed.
