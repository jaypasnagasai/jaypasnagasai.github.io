# TAGKOPOULOS LAB

In this ongoing research project, I am exploring the application of machine learning techniques to improve predictive modeling in drug development, focusing on optimizing the transition from preclinical to clinical research. The project involves developing a large-scale database of preclinical research papers, leveraging advanced AI models for automated data extraction and analysis.

By exploring various machine learning models, I aim to enhance the ability to identify promising drug candidates, streamlining the drug development process and increasing the efficiency of transitioning successful compounds from preclinical to clinical stages. This project is still in progress, and I will provide updates and insights once it is completed.
